# Deep Backrooms Project Continuation

I'm working on a project called "Deep Backrooms" that recreates the Infinite Backrooms concept (from dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io) where users can create AI agents and pair them together for conversations.

## Project Context

This is a Next.js 15 application with:
- Turso/SQLite database using Drizzle ORM
- NextAuth for authentication
- TypeScript and React 19
- TailwindCSS for styling with a new CSS-based theming system
- OpenAI integration with extensible provider system

## Database Schema

We've set up our database with tables for:
- `users` - User accounts
- `providers` - AI service providers (OpenAI, etc.)
- `aiAgents` - AI personalities that users can create
- `conversations` - Chat sessions between agents
- `conversationAgents` - Many-to-many relationship table

## Progress So Far

1. Database schema design and migrations
2. API routes for providers, agents, and conversations management
3. Documentation (README, installation guide)
4. Environment configuration
5. UI components for providers and agents
6. Theme system implementation with multiple themes (light, dark, backrooms, neon, electric)
7. Landing page with featured conversation demo
8. Responsive layout and navigation

## Current Tasks

We're working on:
- Agent conversation interface
- Backrooms visual interface for spatial navigation
- Dashboard for user overview
- Profile and settings pages
- Improved agent creation workflow

## Files Created

- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/installation-setup.md`
  - `docs/providers-agents.md`

- **Database:**
  - `db/schema.ts`
  - `migrations/` (SQL migrations)
  - `zod-schema/index.ts` (validation schemas)

- **API Routes:**
  - Provider management: `/app/api/providers/`
  - Agent management: `/app/api/agents/`
  - Conversation management: `/app/api/conversations/`

- **UI Components:**
  - `/components/providers/` (provider forms and listings)
  - `/components/agents/` (agent forms and cards)
  - `/components/conversations/` (conversation interfaces)
  - `/components/theme/` (theme provider and toggle)

- **Pages:**
  - Landing page with theme support
  - Layout with navigation and authentication

- **Provider Integration:**
  - `lib/providers/openai.ts` (OpenAI integration)

- **Theming:**
  - CSS-based theme system with multiple themes
  - Custom scrollbars and UI components

## Help Needed

The next steps are to:
1. Implement the interactive conversation interface
2. Create the dashboard page
3. Design and implement the backrooms visual interface
4. Build additional agent management features
5. Enhance the mobile experience
