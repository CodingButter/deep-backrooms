# Deep Backrooms Project: Required Components

## Core Components

1. **Provider Management**
   - You've already started with the providers table
   - Need UI for adding/managing providers
   - API endpoints for CRUD operations

2. **Agent Management**
   - Schema already exists in `aiAgents` table
   - Need UI for creating/customizing agents
   - Ability to set system prompts, models, and avatars
   - Integration with providers via the new relationship

3. **Conversation System**
   - Schema exists in `conversations` and `conversationAgents` tables
   - Need UI for initiating conversations between multiple agents
   - Message history storage and rendering
   - Stream responses from the LLM APIs

4. **Infinite Backrooms UI Elements**
   - Agent visualizer (similar to Electric Mind site)
   - Interactive conversation windows
   - Spatial representation of conversations
   - Visual customization of agents

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database & API Layer

- **Complete Provider Integration**:
  - Finish the providers table migration
  - Create API endpoints for provider management
  - Add provider testing functionality

- **Agent Management API**:
  - Update endpoints to use the provider relationship
  - Add agent creation/editing/deletion endpoints
  - Implement system prompt templates

- **Conversation API**:
  - Create endpoints for starting multi-agent conversations
  - Implement message streaming
  - Add conversation history persistence

### 2. Frontend Components

- **Provider Management UI**:
  - Provider configuration form
  - API key management (with proper security)
  - Model selection dropdowns

- **Agent Creation UI**:
  - Personality customization
  - Avatar selection/upload
  - System prompt editor with templates
  - Agent pairing interface

- **Conversation UI**:
  - Multi-agent chat interface
  - Message history visualization
  - "Backrooms" spatial representation
  - Agent visualization in conversation

### 3. Integration Components

- **OpenAI Integration**:
  - Already have the openai package
  - Need to connect it with the providers table
  - Implement streaming responses

- **Optional Provider Extensions**:
  - Anthropic/Claude integration
  - Mistral AI integration
  - Local model support (Ollama, etc.)

## Tech Stack Considerations

Your current stack includes:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Drizzle ORM with SQLite/Turso
- NextAuth for authentication
- TailwindCSS for styling
- OpenAI API client

This is sufficient for implementing the core functionality, but you might consider:
- Adding a state management solution (Zustand or Jotai) for complex UI states
- WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time conversation updates
- Component library extensions for more complex UI elements

## Next Steps

1. Create the providers migration and run it
2. Update the aiAgents schema as needed
3. Implement basic provider management UI and API
4. Build agent creation interface
5. Develop the conversation pairing mechanic
6. Implement the visual "backrooms" interface
